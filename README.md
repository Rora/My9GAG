# My9GAG
As the official mobile application for a popular website 9GAG has plenty of issues I created my own version. </br>
It is written with C# using Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms.

## Main advantages
<ul>
  <li>No ads at all! - as the result app loads the actual content much faster, 
  UI does not lag and most importantly it saves Internet traffic 
  (instead of receiving 100+ Mb of garbage you receive only as much as content weighs). 
  So now you can enjoy 9GAG even with slow Internet connection and without high-end smartphone</li>
  <li>Simple and clean UI - more space for content and less possibility of missclicking</li>
  <li>Video content does not play automatically and you have full control over the playback</li>
</ul>

## Supported platforms
<ul>
  <li>UWP (Windows 10 - desktop and mobile)</li>
  <li>Android</li>
  <li>iOS</li>
</ul>
